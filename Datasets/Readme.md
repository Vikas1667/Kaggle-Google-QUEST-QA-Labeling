## Submissions are evaluated on the mean column-wise Spearman's correlation coefficient. The Spearman's rank correlation is computed for each target column, and the mean of these values is calculated for the submission score.

### Submission File
#### For each qa_id in the test set, you must predict a probability for each target variable. The predictions should be in the range [0,1]. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

qa_id,question_asker_intent_understanding,...,answer_well_written
6,0.0,...,0.5
8,0.5,...,0.1
18,1.0,...,0.0
etc.
